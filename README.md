# Sentiment Analysis Tool

This script performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Cohere's API. . The get_sentiment function sends a review to Cohere's classification endpoint, which returns whether the review is positive, neutral, or negative. The analyze_reviews function processes a list of reviews, calling get_sentiment for each one and tallying the results. Finally, the script runs a sample analysis on a predefined list of customer reviews, printing the counts of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. This setup enables users to analyze the sentiment of customer feedback efficiently.
